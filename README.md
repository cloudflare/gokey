## A simple vaultless password manager in Go

**gokey** is a password manager, which does not require a password vault.
Instead of storing your passwords in a vault it derives your password on the
fly from your master password and supplied _realm_ string (for example,
resource URL). This way you do not have to manage, backup or sync your password
vault (or trust its management to a third party) as your passwords are
available immediately anywhere.

###### example
```
gokey -p super-secret-master-password -r example.com
```

###### options

  - `-o <output path>` - by default **gokey** outputs generated data to
  `stdout`
  - `-P </path/to/password>` - path to master password file which will be used
  to generate other passwords/keys or to encrypt seed file (see [Modes of
  operation](#modes-of-operation) below, if no master password or master
  password file is provided, **gokey** will ask for it interactively)
  - `-p <master password>` - master password which will be used to generate
  other passwords/keys or to encrypt seed file (see [Modes of
  operation](#modes-of-operation) below, if no master password or master
  password file is provided, **gokey** will ask for it interactively)
  - `-r <password/key realm>` - any string which identifies requested
  password/key, most likely key usage or resource URL
  - `-s <path to seed file>` - needed, if you want to use seed file instead of
  master password as an entropy source (see [Modes of
  operation](#modes-of-operation) below); can be generated with `-t seed` flag
  as described below
  - `-skip <number of bytes>` - number of bytes to skip when reading seed file
  - `-u` - **UNSAFE**, allow generating keys without using a seed file (see
  [Modes of operation](#modes-of-operation) below)
  - `-t <password/key type>` - requested password/key output type
  - `-l <length>` - number of characters in the generated password or number of
  bytes in the generated raw stream (default 10 for "pass" type and 32 for
  "raw" type)

Supported password/key types:
  * `pass` - default, generates a password
  * `seed` - generates a seed file, which can be used with `-s` option later
  * `raw` - generates 32 random bytes (can be used as a symmetric key)
  * `ec256` - generates ECC P-256 private key
  * `ec384` - generates ECC P-384 private key
  * `ec521` - generates ECC P-521 private key
  * `rsa2048` - generates 2048-bit RSA private key
  * `rsa4096` - generates 4096-bit RSA private key
  * `x25519` - generates x25519 (also known as curve25519) ECC private key
  * `ed25519` - generates ed25519 ECC private key

### Installation

The **gokey** command-line utility can be downloaded and compiled using standard
`go install` approach. Assuming you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
installed, do
```
go install github.com/cloudflare/gokey/cmd/gokey@latest
```
The `gokey` binary should appear in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. (Default
`$HOME/go/bin`)

### Modes of operation

**gokey** can generate passwords and cryptographic private keys (ECC and RSA
keys are currently supported). However, without any additional options
specified it uses your master password as a single source of entropy for
generated data. For passwords it is acceptable most of the time, but keys
usually have much higher entropy requirements.

For cases, where higher entropy is required for generated passwords/keys,
**gokey** can use a seed file (a blob with random data) instead of the master
password as a source of entropy.

#### Simple mode (without a seed file)

In simple mode passwords are derived directly from your master password and the
realm string. That is each unique combination of a master password and a realm
string will produce a unique password.

For example, if your master password is `super-secret-master-password` and you
want to generate a password for `example.com`, you would invoke **gokey** like
```
gokey -p super-secret-master-password -r example.com
```

If you need a password for a different resource, (`example2.com`), you would
change the real string
```
gokey -p super-secret-master-password -r example2.com
```
This way you need to remember only your master password and you can always
recreate passwords for your services/resources.

NOTE: In this mode generated passwords are as strong as your master password,
so do have your master password strong enough. You can also derive private keys
from your master password, but keep in mind, that these keys will have low
entropy. That is why it is considered unsafe, so **gokey** does not allow it by
default. If you **_really_** know what you are doing, you can override this
default by supplying `-u` flag.

#### Using a seed file

If you plan to generate not only passwords, but also private keys or you want
to have your passwords/keys with higher entropy, you can use a seed file
instead of the master password. You still need to supply a master password,
when invoking **gokey**, but it will be used only to protect the seed file
itself; all generated passwords/keys will be derived from the data in the seed
file. **gokey** uses seed files protected (encrypted) with your master
password, so it is reasonably safe to store/backup seed files to a third party
location, such as Google Drive or Dropbox.

To generate an encrypted seed file, use
```
gokey -p super-secret-master-password -t seed -o seedfile
```
This will create a seed file `seedfile` with 256 bytes of random data. The data
is encrypted using AES-256-GCM mode and `super-secret-master-password` as a
key.

Then, to generate EC-256 private key for `example.com`, use
```
gokey -p super-secret-master-password -s seedfile -r example.com -t ec256
```

NOTE: you still need to remember your master password and keep a backup copy of
your seed file. If you forget your master password or lose your seed file, you
will lose all derived passwords/keys as well.
